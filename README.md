## About The Project

There are pre-existing libraries like FAISS, which offers similarity search over vector embeddings. This projects deals with the implementation similar semantic search from scratch.

### Notebooks
The this repository consists of two notebooks:-
- <b>Semantic_Search_Scratch.ipynb</b> : This notebooks includes the implementation of semantic search over vector embeddings from scratch.
- <b>FAISS_implementation</b> : This is just a reference notebook that contains different semantic search implementations using FAISS library.

The primary assignment is in the <b>Semantic_Search_Scratch.ipynb</b> and the other one is just for reference.
